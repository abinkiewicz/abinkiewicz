I am thrilled with things we can do with data and how it can influence our life! ✨

- 🔭 I’m currently working on different apps to boost my data science knowledge and skills, eg.:
  - **Preorder Me: order helper for procurement specialists** (https://github.com/abinkiewicz/preorder_me),
  - **Business Me: KPIs calculator for financial data analysis and Power BI dashboards** (https://github.com/abinkiewicz/business_me),
  - Mate Me: clustering people's data from the course to find my matching friend (https://github.com/abinkiewicz/mate_me),
  - Transcript Me: app for transcripting my thoughts recorded in .mp3 (https://github.com/abinkiewicz/transcript_me),
  - Equestrian Me: my personal horse trainer (https://github.com/abinkiewicz/equestrian_me).

    In portfolio also: projects with **EDA**, **data preprocessing**, **multi-source integration**, all of them **Python**.
- 🌱 I’m learning how to use different **machine learning models** to make magic with data, while rediscovering the **power of Excel** and developing my **Power BI skills** — especially in the context of **clear, insightful dashboards and data visualizations**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects connected with data analysis, transformation and overall usage.
  
- 💬 Ask me about anything connected with my work.
